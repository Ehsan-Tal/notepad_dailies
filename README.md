# NotePadDailies
 A day-based productivity & task tracker that works with text files and a python script.

 My vision for this is a receipt for the everyday activities, progress, and assessments.
 
# Usage
 Simply run it either in console, with a double click, or however you run your python scripts.
 
 It will then produce a .txt file with its corresponding Gregorian date.
 
 You can then track whether you have done those activities, your progress on the books, shows, or whatever else.
