# NotePadDailies
 A day-based task tracker that works with text files and a python script.

 My vision for this is a receipt for the everyday activities, progress, and assessments.
 
# Usage
 Simply run it either in console, with a double click, or however you can run the script.
 
 It will then produce a .txt file with its corresponding – currently – Gregorian date.
 
 You can then functionalise your activties, track whether you have done those activities, or your progress on the books, shows, or whatever else.
 
 Although, most default things will necessitate right-clicking or editing the script since I have not yet introduced an alternative.

# Future changes
 As I said in the initial commit, this needs to be documented and functionalised to the point that coding this in another language would be a cakewalk. Preferably one that does not trigger every antivirus.
 
 A system where I can click or otherwise specify if tomorrow will be an 'exercise day' or one of university work, etc. 
 This is to reduce fluff that may obscure my focus on what I am to do that day.

 I would also like to make it easier to add quotes, mores, and little packets of "wisdom" at the top, perhaps by using a csv or text file.

 I will theme each version, so that I do not make many changes to the calendar systems and perhaps be satisfied with the work I accomplish rather than chase castles in the sky.

 I would also like a randomised pixel design on top or bottom, maybe 300x300 or some other measurement.

 I would also like an option when deciding which activities to do – i.e., which groups will be printed, e.g., Voice or Albanian or Auto_Invoice, etc. – for whichever day it belongs to, so that I do not have to worry or delete them manually, and it would add conformity.

 Those methods and sayings extracted to a different file.
 
 A summary word to describe any special event or primary activity to aid in discrimination.

 Perhaps for the hijri dates, one full right-left, the next full left-right
 
 # Known Issues
  Right-to-left scripts interacting with left-to-right scripts on the same line.
