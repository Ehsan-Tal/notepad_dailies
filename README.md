# NotePadDailies
 A day-based task tracker that works with text files and a python script.

 My vision for this is a receipt for the everyday activities, progress, and assessments.

# Future changes
 As I said in the initial commit, this needs to be documented and functionalised to the point that coding this in another language would be a cakewalk. Preferably one that does not trigger every antivirus.

 I would also like to make it easier to add quotes, mores, and little packets of "wisdom" at the top, perhaps by using a csv or text file.

 I will theme each version, so that I do not make many changes to the calendar systems and perhaps be satisfied with the work I accomplish rather than chase castles in the sky.

 I would also like a randomised pixel design on top or bottom, maybe 300x300 or some other measurement.

 I would also like an option when deciding which activities to do – i.e., which groups will be printed, e.g., Voice or Albanian or Auto_Invoice, etc. – for whichever day it belongs to, so that I do not have to worry or delete them manually, and it would add conformity.

 Those methods and sayings removed to a different file.
 
 A summary word to describe any special event or primary activity to aid in discrimination.

 Perhaps for the hijri dates, one full right-left, the next full left-right
